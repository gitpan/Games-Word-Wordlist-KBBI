SYNOPSIS
      use Games::Word::Wordlist::KBBI;
      my $wl = Games::Word::Wordlist::KBBI->new;
      my $word = $wl->random_word;
      print "We have a word." if $wl->is_word ($word);

DESCRIPTION
    "Games::Word::Wordlist::KBBI" subclasses Games::Word::Wordlist, giving
    you a managable wordlist preloaded with the Indonesian words from Kamus
    Besar Bahasa Indonesia (currently the third edition, 2001). It contains
    entries from the dictionary minus ones that have non-alphanumeric
    characters. There are capitalized words, acronyms, as well as
    all-lowercase ones.

    Some stats:

     Number of words: 47380
     Shortest word length: 1
     Longest word length: 24
     Average word length: 7.76 characters
     Number of 5-letter words: 6799

    Since "Games::Word::Wordlist" is subclassed, all its methods (except
    "new") are available.

    Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia is the definitive Indonesian dictionary,
    published by Pusat Bahasa.
